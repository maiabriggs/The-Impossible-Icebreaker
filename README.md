# The-Impossible-Icebreaker

#Its an Icebreaker but impossible!

For the first five questions for example, we could structure it so that:
Those five questions are different category questions? 
e.g. first is what is your name. 
second is what is your spirit animal etc..
Then we have different question sets in different text files.
and a question is randomly selected from the question set file.
